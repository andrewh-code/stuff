PAGE 3 - testing

Given a table 'mailing':

CREATE TABLE mailing (
	addr VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

The mailing table will initially be empty.  New addresses will be added on a daily basis.  It is expected that the table will store at least 10,000,000 email addresses and 100,000 domains.

Write a python script that updates another table which holds a daily count of email addresses by their domain name.

Use this table to report the top 50 domains by count sorted by percentage growth of the last 30 days compared to the total.

** NOTE **

- The original mailing table should not be modified.
- All processing must be done in Perl/PHP/Python/whatever language you are using (eg. no complex queries or sub-queries)
- Submit a compressed file(tar/zip) with the files required to run your script.

testing
- unique domains?
- test for valid e-mails? valid domains?
- upper case/ lower case sensitivity? (invalid char? number? symbols? etc)
- test 10 000 000 e-mails, 100 000 domains
- create script with 10 000 000 e-mails and 100 000 domains
- encrypting e-mail addresses with hash? etc
- dupliicate e-mails?
- what if no new e-mails registered for a particular day?
set assumptions
- use MYSQL, Python
- e-mail addresses are added to the table every day (including holidays, weekends, non-business days, basically 365 days a year)
