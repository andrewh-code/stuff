REQUIREMENTS/CASE
==============================
Given a table 'mailing':

CREATE TABLE mailing (
	addr VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

The mailing table will initially be empty.  New addresses will be added on a daily basis.  It is expected that the table will store at least 10,000,000 email addresses and 100,000 domains.

Write a Perl script that updates another table which holds a daily count of email addresses by their domain name.

Use this table to report the top 50 domains by count sorted by percentage growth of the last 30 days compared to the total.

** NOTE **

- The original mailing table should not be modified.
- All processing must be done in Perl/PHP/Python/whatever language you are using (eg. no complex queries or sub-queries)
- Submit a compressed file(tar/zip) with the files required to run your script.

        domaincount BIGINT
    );

    ASSUMPTIONS/DESIGN DECISIONS
    ==============================
    -   Free (open source) products will be used for this case. MySQL is used so there is a possibility that 
        MySQL specific commands will be used. If DB2 was used, then DB2 specific commands could be used and may not
        be compatible with Oracle/MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server,
        
        ex) DB2 SQL:  select current date as today from t1      --> does not work on MySQL
            MySQL:    select date(now()) as today from t1

    -   Assume another process/program/script has already validated and verified the e-mails before being inserted
        into the table. The e-mails are valid and used:
        
        invalid e-mails like:
        test@@gmail.com
        @test.com
        testing <testing@gmail.com>
        test@testing..com
        &%^(%$@blah.com
        
        should not be found in the table.
        Duplicates should not be allowed, even though the MAILING table does not have any constraints on this (UNIQUE) but
        another process/program/script should take care of it

    -   The second table is named, DOMAIN_COUNT. As an afterthought, naming one of the columns DOMAINCOUNT is not a good idea.
        The changes of making SQL Syntax errors increase dramatically when you have a table name and column name that are
        very similar to each other.
        3 columns were created: day, domain, domaincount
        
        It was deemed necessary to put in a column for the date as it is important to keep track of the change in growth during
        the 30 day time period. It is easier to calculate it through SQL as opposed to implementing it in Python/Perl.
        
        Domain's datatype is set to varchar(255) just like the addr column of MAILING. The field can be smaller but for safety purposes, 
        it was put in (for extreme cases)
        
        domaincount's datatype is BIGINT which has a max unsiqned value of 18446744073709551615. Although most likely space on the database
        server may run out before the BIGINT limit is reached for one domain name, it is there as a safety feature. INT would suffice as well as 
        its maximum unsigned value is 4294967295. It also stores half the Bytes as BIGINT so it is a better option for storage purposes.
        
    -   Since the first table stores at least 10,000,000 e-mails (with 100,000 domains), there is the possibility that
        at any given day (even on the first day), at least 10,000,000 e-mails will be added to the table. Even so, millions 
        of e-mails can be added to the table at an ever growing pace. The size of the table can grow exponentially and 
        result in an exponential increase in storage consumption, performance issues, database support costs. It is easier
        to delete the previous day's e-mail entries.
        
        If there is a business decision to not delete the entries in the MAILING table, then a possible solution to meet the requirement
        is to use an SQL query to select all the unique domains and their corresponding total count. Although, this would constitute (to me)
        as a complex query to implement so to implement this, execute the following SQL statement:
            
            SELECT DISTINCT(domain) FROM domain_count
            
        Then use the programming language to move the SQL results into an array/list. Create a loop and iterate throughout this list while
        executing another SQL statement that gathers the maximum count of each domain:
        
        for python_var_domain in python_domain_list:
            execute SQL: SELECT MAX(domaincount) from domain_count where domain='python_var_domain'
            append SQL to each element of the python_domain_list (effectively creating a hashtable/2D associative array)
            
        

    -   E-mail addresses are added to the table every day (including holidays, weekends, non-business days, basically 365 days a year).
        This is to prevent a possible overload of the database by inserting/committing more than a days worth of e-mails. 
        Even though if days are skipped, it should not affect the end result of storing the domains in another table and 
        finding the top 50 domains (in terms of growth)
        
    -   "Complex" is a relative term. What may seem easy/simple to some may be very hard/complex for others
        Assume queries that fall under 'complex' or sub-queries include keywords like UNION, JOIN, have things
        like nested SELECT statements, use of stored procedures, and views

    -   The solution is divided into two scripts.

        1. The first script grabs the domains and transfers them to the second table
        2. The second script calculates the top 50 domains in the past 30 days
        
        
        Creating a separate class to handle the database functions was looked at but by implementing it there would be a high chance that
        if something happened to the database class or if there were modifications, they would greatly affect 1. and 2. It was decided not to use 
        a database class as this would create higher cohesion and dependancy between the class and 1. and 2.
        
        1. and 2. could have been combined together



QUESTIONS
==============================
- do we need to take into account the actual specific e-mail (before the @) when inserting into the next table
- are there any constraints on the second table? primary and foreign keys? unique constraints? up to our imagination/design?
- worry about reading from MAILING table while it is being updated? 
- sorted by percentage growth as in highest growth first to lowest (last)
- percentage outputted in double? int? float? (how many decimal places)
    - who will be looking at the data? how should we present the data?
- all processing must be done in Perl/PHP/Python so SQL does not do any of that? aka, substring function in SQL should be done in other language?
    - using SQL built in functions like substr(), date(), now(), current date, avg(), count(), etc allowed?

- the first table won't be cleaned out right?
